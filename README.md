# Embedded Computer Networks
These are the lab exercises and and lab sheets for the embedded computer networks module at Sheffield Hallam University.  

This academic year (2018-19) we are using the STM32F7 discovery boards for this module (http://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/32f746gdiscovery.html) and I have written some simple helper functions to help with some of the configuration stuff we are doing in the labs.
